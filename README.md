# outdoor-adventures

Outdoor Adventures Cape Town is aimed at main destination locations in and around the Western Cape Province. Local is lekker so to keep it here other than overseas destinations made me choose my colour scheme. A more African themed website helped me to colour and style my website.

The task was given in a short period of time in order to challenge us to complete the same as in a working enviroment. The more challenging part was implementing sass into the website as this


## Setting up my workspace

- Created a new repository on the Github named ismet94/outdoor-adventures
- Save to desired directory
- Created a base folder structure this included the images folder, icons, css and sass
- Installed sass to the gitbash
- Cloned the outdoor-adventures to the desktop using gitBash
```
git clone https://github.com/ismet94/outdoor-adventures.git

```
- Every update was used using the git bash commands
```
cd outdoor-adventures 
git add .
git commit -m "Message to display on the github website"
git push -u origin master

```
- When working on another work bench the git pull function was used.
```
cd ismet_samsodien_cv
git pull

```
- Used the sass watch function to implement sass into css 
```
sass --watch scss:css
```
- Updated all information using the push function with the GitBash as listed above.
- Created Live Link as listed below
