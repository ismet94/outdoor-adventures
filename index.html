                    The Tweede Tol camp and picnic site is located at the original tollgate of the beautiful Bainskloof Pass, built in 1853. The campsite has 20 standard sites, each with its own braai area. For visitors wanting something more private, there are also six fenced-off campsites, each with its own kitchen and bathroom. The campsite is suitable for caravans, except for sites 22, 24, 25, and 26.

                    Towering 1086 meters over Cape Town, and around 500 million years in the making, Table Mountain is a playground for nature lovers and outdoor enthusiasts alike. Once an island, now boasting more plant species per square kilometer than a tropical jungle, this flat-topped monolith begs exploration. Trails run the length and breadth of the mountain, offering exceptional hiking for all levels of experience and fitness. Whether youâ€™re looking for adventure or solitude, nature or views, a hike up Table Mountain is not to be missed.
